Downloaded and Installed the movie app apk.
Created the test cases using the emulator.
- pixel 6
- android 10

Came out with test cases for sorting, viewing movie info, and book movie functions.

Test suite is for regression testing for the whole software, sorting function, view movie info function and book the movie function.

I have attached the report of the regression testing in the repo.

For the bug tracking assumption, I have attached in the repo.

For the api testing i have used postman and have attached the testing html report in the repo.



For your kind information, this assessment is done by me (Thenmullai A/P Chandra Sekaran) entirely. Due to some technical problem, I had to use my brother's laptop to do the testing.
